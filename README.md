# Dynamic_resource_management_AWS-EC2

## Objective

This project exposes the following AWS technologies: EC2, RDS, S3, CloudWatch and Elastic Load Balancer (ELB).

This project extends the [Face_Mask_Detection_webapp](http://github.com) into an elastic web application that can resize its worker pool on demand. The worker pool is the set of EC2 instances that run the face detection user-app.
